This is a program for controlling motors on the AVR Mega328P. I'm using some
kind of motor controller, so each motor is controlled by two pins. When one is
on and the other off, the motor spins one way. When this is inverted, the motor
spins in the oppisite direction. When both are off, the motor does not move.
